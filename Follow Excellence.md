### Sayings

#### Winston Churchill

> I have never developed indigestion from eating my words.

> I have had to eat my own words many times, and I have found it a very nourishing diet.

> If you are going through hell, keep going.

> Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.

> You will never reach your destination if you stop and throw stones at every dog that barks.

> When you’re 20 you care what everyone thinks, when you’re 40 you stop caring what everyone thinks, when you’re 60 you realize no one was ever thinking about you in the first place. You have enemies? Good. That means you’ve stood up for something, sometime in your life.

> To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often.

> Never give up on something that you can’t go a day without thinking about.

> My tastes are simple: I am easily satisfied with the best.

> If you find a job you love, you’ll never work again...

> A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on.

> There is no time for ease and comfort. It is the time to dare and endure.

> I am always ready to learn although I do not always like being taught.

> If you don’t take change by the hand, it will take you by the throat.



#### Tony Horton

> Focus on the present moment. Stay in the moment.

> Rome wasn’t built in a day. And neither was your body.

> All I ask is that you do your best, and forget the rest.

> Don’t say ‘I can’t', say ‘I presently struggle with'.

> Aging is for people who don’t know any better.

> Eliminate the mindset of can’t! Because you can do anything!

> Don’t let your ego get in the way of your success.

> Tip of the day- Don’t smash your face!

> You can do anything for 30 seconds.

> Exercise for the joy of feeling good and getting better. Eat right with the intention of fueling your body with the things it needs to perform.

> Excuses are a list of self imposed obstacles that prevent you from having a better life.

> You can get better, or you can get all gooey, and crotchety, old, pathetic, icky, gross. Not me. Not into it.

> You don’t get off easy, you just get to finish faster!

> The health care problem is not solved in the white house, its solved in YOUR HOUSE.



#### Eminem

> Sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak. And when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up. But you gotta search within you, try and find that inner strength. And just pull that shit out of you, and get that motivation to not give up. And not be a quitter no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face.

> To the rest of world, god gave you shoes that fit you. Just put them on and wear them. Be yourself, man. Be proud of Who you are. And even if it sounds corny, never let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful.



#### Steve Jobs

> Stay hungry, stay foolish.

> The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.

> Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life’s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.

> You've got to find what you love. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking and don't settle.

> And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.

> If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you will most certainly be right.

> Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking.



#### Mixed

> If you want to be a good programmer, you just program every day for two years, you will be an excellent programmer. If you want to be a world-class programmer, you can program every day for ten years, or you can program every day for two years and take an algorithms class.

> Have no fear of perfection - you'll never reach it. 				—— Salvador Dalí

> Wars come and go, but my soldiers stay eternal.

> After the night I burned all memory, my dream becomes transparent, as I trashed all yesterdays, my step becomes lighter.	—— Rabindranath Tagore

> 有志者，事竟成，破釜沉舟，百二秦关终属楚。
>
> 苦心人，天不负，卧薪尝胆，三千越甲可吞吴。

> 我是一文不值，狗屁不如，你呢，就是犹如狗屁，值得一闻。

> 手拿菜刀砍电线，一路火花带闪电；高楼大厦平地起，靠谁不如靠自己。
>
> 软中华,硬玉溪，头发越短越牛逼；骑着狼，放着羊，唱着山歌耍流氓。

> Parting your soup is not a miracle. It's a magic trick. A single mom who's working two jobs and still finds time to take her kid to soccer practice. That's a miracle. A teenager who says no to drugs and yes to an education. That's a miracle. People want me to do everything for them. What they don't realize is they have the power. You want to see a miracle, son? Be the miracle.
